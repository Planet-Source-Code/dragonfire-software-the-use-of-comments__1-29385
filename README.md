### Source Code

<font face="Verdana" size="+1">Introduction<p></font><font face="Verdana" size="-1">Have you ever downloaded a file on PSC just to realize it has no comments what so ever and the code is some of the worst structured/named code you have ever seen? Well it most likely got a bad vote, and no one liked it...Well this is one of the many reasons Micrsoft has allowed for comments in Visual Basic Projects.</font><p>
<font face="Verdana" size=+1>How to start a comment</font>
<font face="Verdana" size="-1"><p>You start a comment by adding a "'" (Apostrophe) mark(Apostrophe) mark or by using a "Rem:" as the beginning of a comment <b>Line</b>. <b>Notice this only refers to a line, not a paragraph.</b> If you want to make paragraphs you have to use the <b>Line continuation character "_"</b> at the end of each line that you want to seperate. The text then in turn becomes green (or what ever comment code is colored in your options, by default it is green) and you may begin to proceed typing what you want.<p></font>
<font face="Verdana" size="+1">When to use them<p></font><font face="Verdana" size="-1">
You should try to use comments whenever possible. Use them for variables, to tell what the variable does. Use it in procedures to say what the purpose is for. Use them whenever.</font><p>
<font face="Verdana" size="+1">Feedback<p><font face="Verdana" size="-1">
What is the purpose of feed back? To tell the author what you think of the program, any bugs that can be found, what should be removed or added. But why doesn't half the people on PSC ever give some sort of appreciation or comments about a users work. At least try to show that you like the code by <b>Voting</b>. This is a very useful tool, to rate the authors work. If everyone left feedback, then we would have much better submissions, and much better updates. Another thing to note is that <b>Don't ever post an article, which is in turn actually a question that wasn't answered in the forums. All though these forums, aren't very active, still look around your answer maybe found in the millions of lines of code in PSC. Good luck all!<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/dragonfire_software/mainframes.html">Dragonfire Software</a><p>
